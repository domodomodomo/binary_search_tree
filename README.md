## binary search tree

### 1. sample.py  
usage of this code

### 2. binary\_searh\_tree.py  
main code

### 3. binary\_searh\_tree\_parent.py  
Another implmentation of binary search tree.
In this code BinarySearchNode class has parent attribute.
This script was written to show you parent attribute is not reuiqred in binary search tree.
The parent attribute make code more complicated.

### 4. log.py  
log.output(bst: BinarySearchTree) function shows you a tree structrue in console.

### 5. graph.py
graph.render(bst: BinarySearchTree) creates an image file.
This module requires graphviz moudle.

### 6. test.py  
test code for binary\_searh\_tree.py and binary\_searh\_tree\_parent.py
